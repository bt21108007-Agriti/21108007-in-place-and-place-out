Ques-3. Suggest some practical examples of using in-place and out-place techniques.
Ans-3 

In-place techniques- Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting technique. It usually
also excludes the space used for stack in recursive algorithms. Quick sort, uses only some
constant number of variables for partitioning purpose. So, is in-place algorithm.


Out-place techniques- In merge sort, merge function requires extra linear space which is not
constant. So, it is not in-place. Hence, it is called 'out of place' algorithm. Among the
comparison based techniques discussed, only Insertion Sort qualifies for this because of the
underlying algorithm it uses i.e. it processes the array (not just elements) from left to right
and if new elements are added to the right, it doesnâ€™t impact the ongoing operation.
